// IMPORT THE PROVIDER COMPONENT FROM REACT-REDUX AND THE STORE

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';

import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';

// WRAPPING THE APP COMPONENT IN THE PROVIDER COMPONENT GIVES THE ENTIRE APPLICATION ACCESS TO WHATEVER IS IN THE STORE, BECAUSE WE PASS IN THE STORE AS A PROP TO THE PROVIDER, AND WRAP OUR PROVIDER AROUND OUR APP

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store} >
    <App />
  </Provider>
  , document.getElementById('root'));

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: http://bit.ly/CRA-PWA
serviceWorker.unregister();
